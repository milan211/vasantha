quality gate-  Quality Gate in SonarQube is a set of predefined conditions that your code must meet to be considered "passing" or "acceptable" in terms of quality. 
It acts as a gatekeeper for code quality by defining a set of thresholds for various metrics,such as code coverage, code duplication, number of bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities
