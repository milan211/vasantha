Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.

When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project.

You can even switch between branches and work on different projects
create a new branch
git branch hello-world-images
git checkout -b emergency-fix
git merge emergency-fix
git branch -d emergency-fix
Deleted branch emergency-fix 
Since we have already set up a local Git repo, we are going to push that to GitHub:
git remote add origin https://github.com/w3schools-test/hello-world.git
git push --set-upstream origin master
pull is a combination of 2 different commands:
fetch
merge
git fetch origin
git log origin/master
git diff origin/master
git pull origin
A Pull Request notifies people you have changes ready for them to consider or review.

 You can ask others to review your changes or pull your contribution and merge it into their branch
When sharing your code with others, there are often files or parts of your project, you do not want to share.

Examples

log files
temporary files
hidden files
personal files
etc.
Git can specify which files or parts of your project should be ignored by Git using a .gitignore file.
# ignore ALL .log files
*.log

# ignore ALL files in ANY directory named temp
temp/
Now all .log files and anything in temp folders will be ignored by Git.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "test@w3schools.com"
SSH is a secure shell network protocol that is used for network management, remote file transfer, and remote system access.

SSH uses a pair of SSH keys to establish an authenticated and encrypted secure network protocol. It allows for secure remote communication on unsecured open networks.

SSH keys are used to initiate a secure "handshake". When generating a set of keys, you will generate a "public" and "private" key.

The "public" key is the one you share with the remote party. Think of this more as the lock.

The "private" key is the one you keep for yourself in a secure place. Think of this as the key to the lock.
test our connection via SSH to GitHub
ssh -T git@github.com
revert is the command we use when we want to take a previous commit and add it as a new commit, keeping the log intact.
git revert HEAD --no-edit
reset is the command we use when we want to move the repository back to a previous commit, discarding any changes made after that commit.
commit --amend is used to modify the most recent commit.

It combines changes in the staging environment with the latest commit, and creates a new commit.

This new commit replaces the latest commit entirely.
