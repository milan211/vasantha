tomcat is web application server where we can deploy war files butt not ear files
installation:
lets create centos7 vm in gccloud of size by default 20gb e2 medium type (we will get equivalent code u can copy in the shell and create vm)
install java1.8
install tomcat9
after installing we need to give executable permissions for startup.sh file present in bin folder in apache....zip file
chmod +x *
then tomcat start running u can verify sh startup.sh
if u want to stop sh shutdown.sh
u can check whether tomcat is running or not --ps -ef|grep -i java* or ps -ef|grep -i apache*


instead of going into bin folder and always doing sh startup.sh or shutdown.sh
-go to /root folder
ln -s /opt/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh /usr/bin/startTomcat
ln -s /opt/tomcat9/bin/shutdown.sh /usr/bin/stopTomcat

heirarchy of tomcat:
bin-consists of startup.sh,shutdown.sh,catalina.sh(important file (restart)in tomcat),startup.bat,shutdown.bat
conf- consists of server.xml and tomcat-users.xml
lib - consists of jar files
logs- consists of logs when we start tomcat it generates 4 log files
webapps-by default applications will be present here and also the applications we deployed will be present in wwebapps folder

tomcat dashboard by default we dont have access to see the manager  and host applications for that we need to comment the value in manager and host applications

we can also deploy multiple applications on one tomcat server.... in context path u need to give /cart 

to choose war file we czn use winscp to copy the war file from tomcat server to local machine

when we are facing internet we wont expose application servers for that configuring proxy servers to run tomcat servers behind that	


/opt/tomcat9/conf/server.xml----connector port="8085" proxy port="80"(done modification in tomcat server)
/etc/httpd/conf.d/tomcat_manager.conf  --vim tomcat_manager.conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
    serverName: ipaddress
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8085/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8085/
</VirtualHost>
